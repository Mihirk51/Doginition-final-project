PROJECT DESCRIPTION



Dognition (http://www.dognition.com) is a company that teaches you how to build a deeper connection with your dog 
by giving you an unprecedented perspective on your dog’s personality and capabilities. As we learned in the “Meet 
Your Dognition Data” video, the company has tasked us with helping them figure out what business changes they could 
implement to increase the number of tests users complete on their website.

Dognition has provided us with a dataset to analyze in order to develop your recommendations. You have read the data 
set description and have analyzed this data set to gain insight into customer’s behavior through the practice exercises 
you completed in Weeks 2 and 3.

Your job now is to give a 5-minute presentation to the Dognition management team about what they could do to increase the 
number of tests users complete. You will make this recommendation based on what you learned through analyzing the data in 
the practice exercises and any additional analysis you did on your own. 

There is no one correct recommendation to make to Dognition. Just like other real-world business analysis situations, you will need to use your own judgment to decide on the best recommendation to make.
Please note: The Dognition data set provided for this project is proprietary and is not intended to be shared publicly.
